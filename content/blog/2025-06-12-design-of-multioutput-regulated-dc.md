## Introduction

This article details the design and operation of a regulated multi-output DC power supply suitable for powering multiple electronic circuits simultaneously. Built using fundamental analog components, the system is powered from a standard 220V AC mains and delivers four regulated outputs: 24V, 12V, 5V, and 3.3V. Key components include a step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, filter capacitors, LM317T linear regulators, and a Zener diode. This power supply is ideal for prototyping labs, embedded system development, and educational purposes in electronics.

This article presents a complete and beginner-friendly design that:

* Converts 220V AC to multiple low-voltage DC outputs
* Offers four regulated output levels: 24V, 12V, 5V, and 3.3V
* Uses discrete linear regulators (LM317T) instead of prebuilt modules
* Demonstrates key principles of analog power electronics

## Circuit Overview

### Multisim and Bench Circuit Diagram

*Figure 1 and Figure 2 below illustrate the simulated and physical circuit respectively.*

## Transformer Stage – Voltage Step-Down

**Transformer Specifications:**

* Type: EI-76X45
* Output: 24-0-24V AC, 5A, 50Hz

A center-tapped step-down transformer converts the 220V AC mains to 24 V AC. This center-tap configuration is a common method for achieving full-wave rectification, especially at higher voltages. The peak voltage after rectification reaches approximately 34V. This provides sufficient headroom for voltage regulation down to 24 V, 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V while ensuring continuous operation at up to 1 A per output rail.

### Simulation Output

## Rectification Stage – AC to DC Conversion

A full-wave bridge rectifier using four HER307 high-speed diodes (D1–D4) converts the AC voltage into pulsating DC. The diodes have the following specifications:

* Average Forward Current: 3A
* Peak Reverse Voltage: 1000V
* Fast Recovery Time

Refer to : [alldatasheet-HER307](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/58731/DCCOM/HER307.html) for more details.
### Peak Voltage Calculation

$V_{peak} = V_{rms} \times \sqrt{2} = 24V \times 1.414 \approx 33.9V$

Accounting for two diode drops (\~1.4V):

$V_{DC} \approx 33.9V - 1.4V = 32.5V$

### Simulation Output

## Filtering Stage – Ripple Reduction

**Bulk Filtering:**
A 4700μF, 50V electrolytic capacitor is used to smooth the rectified voltage and reduce ripple.

**Additional Capacitors:**
Smaller capacitors (100μF, 33μF) placed after each regulator further suppress high-frequency noise and improve transient response.

## Voltage Regulation Stage – LM317T Adjustable Regulators

The LM317T is a 3-terminal adjustable regulator capable of supplying 1.2V to 37V at up to 1.5A. In this design, each regulated output is configured for a maximum load current of 1 A, ensuring thermal and electrical reliability within device limits. 

Refer to:[alldatasheet-LM317T](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/558026/TI1/LM317T.html) for details.

### Why LM317T Instead of 78XX Series?
While fixed-voltage regulators like the 7805 or 7812 are convenient, the LM317T offers key advantages in this application:

* Adjustability: A single regulator can be configured for multiple voltages using external resistors.
* Greater flexibility: Ideal for custom or non-standard voltage rails.
* Improved line and load regulation: Superior transient response and output accuracy with proper bypassing.
* Availability and cost: Readily available and cost-effective for educational and prototyping purposes.



**Output Voltage Formula:**
$V_{out} = 1.25V \times \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)$

### 24V Output (U1)

* R1 = 1kΩ, R2 = 18.2kΩ
* $V_{out1} = 1.25 \times (1 + 18.2k / 1k) \approx 24V$
* Applicable in; Powering relays, motor drivers, audio amplifiers
* Capacitors: 300μF and 33μF

### 12V Output (U2)

* R1 = 1kΩ, R2 = 8.6kΩ
* $V_{out2} = 1.25 \times (1 + 8.6k / 1k) \approx 12V$
* Common applications include; powering logic circuits, operational amplifiers, and development boards
### 5V Output (U3)

* R1 = 240Ω, R2 = 720Ω
* $V_{out3} = 1.25 \times (1 + 720 / 240) = 5V$
* Applicable in; Microcontrollers, USB-powered devices

## 3.3V Zener Clamp

A 1N4728A Zener diode clamps the 5V rail to 3.3V for low-current applications.

* Zener Voltage: 3.3V
* Power Rating: 1W
* Series resistor (10Ω) limits current

**Note:** Zener diodes are not efficient for high-current regulation; use only for low-power logic or reference lines.Refer to: [alldatasheet-1N4728A](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/562536/VISHAY/1N4728A.html) for more details.

## Thermal and Safety Considerations

* **Heat Dissipation:** LM317s can dissipate significant heat. For example:
  $P = (32V - 12V) \times 1A = 20W$
  Use heat sinks accordingly.
* **Enclosure:** Use a ventilated metal or plastic enclosure.
* **Fusing:** Place fuses or PTC resettable fuses after the transformer.
* **Isolation:** Ensure the transformer provides safe mains isolation.

## Applications

This multi-output power supply is:

* Ideal for educational electronics labs
* Simple and low-cost to build
* Versatile for powering multiple circuit types

**Typical Use Cases:**

* Microcontroller prototyping
* Powering 5V/12V modules simultaneously
* Audio circuits with 24V rails
* Logic-level shifting or analog reference supply
